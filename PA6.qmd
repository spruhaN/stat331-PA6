## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
<<<<<<< HEAD
A <- matrix(runif(121), nrow = 11, ncol = 11)
B <- A * A
A
B
=======
13 * 13
>>>>>>> 0201f2f0ad5376c63b5fb696504e25a305fb6333
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
